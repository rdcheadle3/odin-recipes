        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds red potatoes, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) container sour cream</li>
                <li>1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups cooked bacon, crumbled</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>2 bunches green onions, thinly sliced</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over 
                    high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. 
                    Drain, then run under cold water until cool.</li>

                <li>Combine the sour cream and ranch dressing mix in a small bowl until well-blended. 
                    Transfer the potatoes, bacon, Cheddar cheese, and green onions to a large bowl. 
                    Stir in the sour cream mixture until well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for about 2 hours 
                    before serving.</li>
            </ol>
